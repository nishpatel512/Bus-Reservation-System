# Bus-Reservation-System

# ABSTRACT
This Bus Reservation System web application provides users with the ability to search for buses, view available buses, and book tickets for buses. The website features user login, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application. The project also includes several other features to enhance the user experience. For example, users can create an account on the website, which allows them to save their travel details, view their booking history etc. Overall, the Bus Reservation project is a comprehensive web application for managing buses and bookings, built using Django and offering a range of useful features for users.

# METHODOLOGY
The methodology for the Bus Booking website involves using Django for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. User account creation is implemented through a registration form, Ticket cancellation is facilitated through a cancellation form, and users can view their previously booked tickets, both confirmed and cancelled. As-you-type search functionality is also implemented to help users find bus information quickly and easily.
1. User Account Creation:
The methodology for user account creation likely involves implementing a registration form that collects the user's personal information, such as their username, email address, and password. The form data is then processed by the Django backend, which validates the data and creates a new user account in the database. The website may also implement user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in user authentication system, which allows users to log in and access certain pages or features of the website based on their user role.
2. Ticket Booking:
The methodology for booking likely involves implementing a booking form that allows users to select their source and destination, dates. The form data is then processed by the Django backend, which searches the bus database for available buses that match the user's criteria. On successful match with the user request, the form then asks for the number of passengers. The backend then calculates the total cost of the selected bus and presents it to the user for confirmation. Upon confirmation, the user's booking details are stored in the database.
3. Ticket Viewing:
The methodology for ticket viewing likely involves implementing a page that displays the user's previously booked tickets, both confirmed and cancelled. The page retrieves the user's booking data from the database and presents it in a clear and user-friendly format, including details such as source, destination and number of passengers, price, date and status of booking.
4. Ticket Cancellation:
The methodology for ticket cancellation likely involves implementing a cancellation form that allows users to enter their booking id number. The form data is then processed by the Django backend, which searches the database for the corresponding booking and marks it as cancelled.
5. As-you-type Search:
The methodology for implementing an as-you-type search functionality likely involves using JavaScript or a similar front-end technology to capture user input and send it to the Django backend for processing. The backend then performs a search of the bus database based on the user's input and returns the relevant results. The results are then displayed on the page in real-time, allowing the user to see their search results as they type. This can help users find the information they need more quickly and easily.
